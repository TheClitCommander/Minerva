# Think Tank Mode Documentation

## Overview

Think Tank mode is an advanced AI orchestration system that selects, processes, and ranks responses from multiple AI models to deliver the highest quality output for each user query. By leveraging the strengths of different models and implementing sophisticated evaluation mechanisms, Think Tank ensures optimal responses across a wide range of query types.

## How It Works

The Think Tank mode follows a systematic process flow:

1. **Query Analysis**: Analyzes the user's query to determine its complexity, type (technical, creative, reasoning, or general), and other characteristics.

2. **Model Selection**: Based on the query analysis, selects the most appropriate AI models from the available pool. Models are chosen based on their suitability for the specific query type.

3. **Parallel Processing**: Processes the query simultaneously with all selected models to generate multiple candidate responses.

4. **Response Evaluation**: Evaluates each response based on comprehensive quality metrics including relevance, coherence, correctness, and helpfulness.

5. **Response Ranking**: Ranks the responses considering both their quality scores and the capabilities of their source models in relation to the query type.

6. **Best Response Selection**: Returns the highest-ranked response to the user, ensuring optimal quality and relevance.

## Key Components

### Enhanced Query Analyzer

The query analyzer performs detailed analysis of user messages to identify:

- Query complexity (1-10 scale)
- Query type classification (technical, creative, analytical, factual)
- Domain and topic identification
- Feature extraction for improved routing

### Think Tank Processor

The core component that handles:

- Model selection based on routing decisions
- Processing messages with appropriate models
- Evaluating and ranking responses
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms

### Response Quality Evaluation

A sophisticated evaluation system that assesses:

- Content relevance to the query
- Coherence and structure quality
- Response completeness and helpfulness
- Absence of problematic patterns (like AI self-references)

### Model Capabilities System

A database of model strengths across different dimensions:

- Technical expertise
- Creative writing
- Reasoning capability
- Mathematical reasoning
- Long context handling
- Instruction following

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Use Think Tank Mode

Think Tank mode is particularly effective for:

- Complex technical queries requiring accurate information
- Creative tasks like storytelling or content generation
- Analytical questions requiring nuanced reasoning
- Queries where response quality is critical
- Situations where you want to benefit from the strengths of multiple AI models

### Configuration Options

The Think Tank mode can be configured with:

- `available_models`: Specify which models should be considered for selection
- `min_quality_threshold`: Set the minimum acceptable quality score
- Custom capability profiles for new or fine-tuned models

## Performance Monitoring

The Think Tank system includes built-in analytics and monitoring:

- Detailed logging of model selection decisions
- Quality scores for all generated responses
- Performance metrics by query type
- Analysis tools for continuous improvement

Use the `think_tank_analyzer.py` script to generate performance reports and visualizations based on test results.

## Technical Notes

### Integration with Model Registry

Think Tank seamlessly integrates with the model registry system to:

- Dynamically discover available models
- Retrieve capability profiles for registered models
- Update routing decisions based on model availability

### Error Handling

The system implements robust error handling to ensure reliability:

- Fallback mechanisms when preferred models are unavailable
- Graceful degradation when components fail
- Intelligent defaults when quality evaluation returns unexpected formats
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

## Example Usage

```python
from web.think_tank_processor import process_with_think_tank

# Simple usage with default models
response = process_with_think_tank("What is quantum computing?")

# Specify available models
models = ["gpt-4", "claude-3", "gemini"]
response = process_with_think_tank("Write a short story about space exploration", available_models=models)
```

## Optimization Tips

To get the best results from Think Tank mode:

1. **Ensure Diverse Model Coverage**: Include models with different strengths in your available models list.

2. **Regular Testing**: Run the test suite regularly to validate performance across different query types.

3. **Review Analytics**: Use the analyzer tool to identify patterns and opportunities for improvement.

4. **Custom Model Profiles**: Update model capability profiles as new versions are released or as you observe performance changes.

5. **Query Formatting**: For optimal routing, ensure queries are clear and specific about the type of response needed.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with Think Tank mode:

1. **Check Logs**: Review the detailed logs for error messages or warnings.

2. **Verify Model Availability**: Ensure that the specified models are available and functioning correctly.

3. **Run Diagnostics**: Use the diagnostic script to trace through the processing pipeline and identify bottlenecks.

4. **Quality Thresholds**: Adjust quality thresholds if too many responses are being rejected.

5. **Model Capabilities**: Update model capability profiles if you notice consistent mismatches between model selection and performance.
