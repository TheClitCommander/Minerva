   - Improved quality assessment by considering model capabilities and query characteristics
   - Added score adjustments based on model-query compatibility (e.g., boosting technical models for technical queries)
   - Enhanced logging with detailed metrics about model performance on different query types

4. **Model Selection Improvements**
   - Ensured priority models are always included when available
   - Added fallback mechanisms when preferred models are unavailable
   - Enhanced model coverage analysis to ensure diversity in model selection

These improvements create a more intelligent Think Tank system that selects the most appropriate models for each query type, evaluates responses more effectively based on model capabilities, and ensures high-quality outputs by matching models to query characteristics.""",

   - Detects common issues like excessive repetition, AI self-references, and incoherent structures
   - Returns detailed validation results with specific reasons for rejection
   - Provides quality scores for responses that can be used for model selection

2. **Enhanced Quality Evaluation**
   - Upgraded the `evaluate_response_quality` function with complexity-aware metrics
   - Implements adaptive length expectations based on query complexity
   - Uses improved relevance scoring with meaningful keyword matching
   - Evaluates response structure for organizational elements like lists, paragraphs, and conclusions

3. **Fallback and Recovery Mechanisms**
   - Added robust error handling throughout the AI router initialization
   - Implemented multiple layers of fallback options for component failures
   - Provides graceful degradation when optimal models are unavailable
   - Ensures system continues to function even with partial component failures

4. **Dynamic Confidence Thresholds**
   - Adjusts confidence thresholds based on query complexity
   - Implements stricter validation for complex queries
   - Uses model capability factors to adjust expectations for different models
   - Provides detailed quality metrics for ongoing system improvement

This implementation ensures that Minerva delivers consistently high-quality responses by filtering out problematic outputs and selecting the best responses based on comprehensive quality metrics.""",

1. **Query Complexity Analysis**
   - Added `analyze_query_complexity` function that evaluates query complexity on a 0.0-1.0 scale
   - Considers factors like query length and presence of complex/simple keywords
   - Uses complexity score to determine how many models to process for optimal performance

2. **Query Type Detection**
   - Implemented `determine_query_type` function that categorizes queries as technical, creative, reasoning, factual, or general
   - Uses keyword analysis to identify the most likely query category
   - Enables more intelligent model selection based on query characteristics

3. **Capability-Aware Model Selection**
   - Created `prioritize_models_for_query` function that matches models to query types based on their capabilities
   - Defined capability scores for each model across different query types
   - Ensures that the most appropriate models are selected for each query type

4. **Parallel Processing for Better Performance**
   - Implemented multi-threading for model processing using `concurrent.futures`
   - Uses complexity-based decision making to determine when parallel processing is beneficial
   - For simple queries or few models, uses sequential processing to avoid overhead
   - For complex queries with multiple models, uses parallel processing with up to 4 workers

5. **Adaptive Model Count Based on Complexity**
   - Uses fewer models (3) for simple queries to improve response time
   - Uses more models (4) for moderately complex queries
   - Uses all available models for highly complex queries that benefit from diverse perspectives
