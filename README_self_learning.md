# Minerva Self-Learning Optimization Engine

This document provides comprehensive information about the Self-Learning Optimization Engine implemented for Minerva, which enables autonomous trend analysis, performance adaptation, and continuous improvement.

## Overview

The Self-Learning Optimization Engine is designed to analyze user interactions and feedback over time, detect performance shifts, and automatically adjust Minerva's behavior to optimize response quality and user satisfaction. The system operates as a continuous learning loop that refines Minerva's performance without requiring manual intervention.

## Architecture

The Self-Learning Optimization Engine consists of three main components:

1. **Trend Analyzer**: Tracks metrics over time and detects meaningful shifts in user engagement and response quality.
2. **Self-Adjustment System**: Determines appropriate parameter adjustments based on detected trends and applies them automatically when confidence is high.
3. **Self-Learning Engine**: Integrates the components and coordinates the overall self-improvement process, including feedback mapping and data processing.

## Key Features

### Performance Metrics Tracking

The system tracks multiple performance metrics:

- **Response Quality**: Measures the perceived quality of Minerva's responses
- **User Satisfaction**: Overall user satisfaction with the AI's performance
- **Engagement Rate**: How actively users interact with responses
- **Expansion Clicks**: Frequency of users expanding truncated responses
- **Helpful Feedback**: Explicit feedback on response helpfulness
- **Interaction Depth**: Depth of user engagement with responses

### Time-Window Analysis

Metrics are analyzed across multiple time windows:

- **1-day window**: Recent performance shifts
- **7-day window**: Medium-term trends
- **30-day window**: Long-term patterns

### Autonomous Adjustment Logic

The system can automatically adjust several parameters based on detected trends:

- **Length**: Response length preferences
- **Detail Level**: How detailed responses should be
- **Tone**: Formal, casual, or neutral tone
- **Structure**: Paragraph, bullet points, or numbered list format

### Confidence-Based Adjustments

The engine uses a confidence scoring system to determine when to make automatic adjustments:

- **High confidence (>0.6)**: Automatic adjustments are applied
- **Medium confidence (0.3-0.6)**: Suggestions are generated for manual review
- **Low confidence (<0.3)**: No action is taken

### User Engagement Profiling

The system generates detailed user engagement profiles that characterize:

- Preferred engagement patterns
- Optimal response formats
- Time-of-day preferences
- Content type preferences

## Integration with Existing Systems

The Self-Learning Optimization Engine integrates with:

- **Real-Time Memory Manager**: To record important adjustments and insights
- **Real-Time Adaptation Engine**: To apply parameter adjustments
- **Multi-AI Context Sync**: To ensure consistent behavior across AI models
- **Global Feedback Manager**: To access and utilize feedback data

## Usage

### Recording Feedback

```python
from ai_decision.self_learning_optimizer import self_learning_engine

# Record explicit feedback
result = self_learning_engine.record_feedback(
    user_id="user123",
    response_id="resp456",
    feedback_type="helpful",
    feedback_value=True,
    source="user"
)
```

### Processing User Data

```python
# Manually trigger data processing for a user
processing_result = self_learning_engine.process_user_data("user123")

# Check the results
if processing_result["status"] == "success":
    adjustments = processing_result["adjustments"]
    suggestions = processing_result["suggestions"]
    print(f"Made {len(adjustments['adjustments_made'])} automatic adjustments")
```

### Getting Learning Insights

```python
# Get detailed learning insights for a user
insights = self_learning_engine.get_learning_insights("user123")

# Access trend data
recent_trends = insights["trends"]["7_day"]
for metric, trend in recent_trends.items():
    print(f"{metric}: {trend['trend_direction']} ({trend['trend_strength']:.2f})")
```

### Applying Manual Adjustments

```python
# Apply a manual adjustment
self_learning_engine.apply_manual_adjustment(
    user_id="user123",
    parameter="detail_level",
    value=0.8  # Higher detail level
)
```

### Resetting Adaptations

```python
# Reset all adaptations to default values
self_learning_engine.reset_user_adaptations("user123")
```

## Configuration Options

The Self-Learning Engine can be configured with the following options:

- **Auto-processing interval**: How often to automatically process user data
- **Minimum confidence threshold**: Confidence required for automatic adjustments
- **Learning rate**: How quickly the system adapts to new trends
- **Cool-down period**: Time required between automatic adjustments

## Metrics-to-Parameter Mapping

The engine uses the following mapping between metrics and parameters:

| Metric | Affected Parameters |
|--------|---------------------|
| Response Quality | Detail Level, Tone |
| User Satisfaction | Detail Level, Tone, Structure |
| Engagement Rate | Length, Detail Level |
| Expansion Clicks | Length |
| Helpful Feedback | Detail Level, Structure |
| Interaction Depth | Length, Detail Level |

## Best Practices

1. **Balance reactivity with stability**: Configure confidence thresholds to avoid over-adjusting based on temporary fluctuations.

2. **Start conservative**: Begin with higher confidence thresholds and gradually lower them as the system proves reliable.

3. **Review suggestions regularly**: Even with automatic adjustments, periodically review the suggested manual adjustments to gain insights.

4. **Monitor adjustments**: Check the adjustment history to understand how Minerva is adapting to user behavior.

5. **Support with manual feedback**: Combine automatic learning with explicit user preferences for optimal results.

## Future Enhancements

Planned future enhancements for the Self-Learning Optimization Engine include:

1. **Cross-user insights**: Learn patterns across multiple users to improve cold-start performance
2. **Enhanced anomaly detection**: More sophisticated methods to identify outliers and irregular patterns
3. **Contextual adjustments**: Adjust parameters differently based on conversation context or topic
4. **Predictive adaptation**: Anticipate user needs based on historical patterns

## Technical Details

The Self-Learning Optimization Engine stores metrics in memory with timestamps, allowing for:
- Efficient time-window calculations
- Anomaly detection with statistical methods
- Detailed trend strength calculation
- Parameter-specific confidence scoring

All adjustments are recorded in the memory system for future reference and transparency, creating a continuous improvement loop that gets better over time.
