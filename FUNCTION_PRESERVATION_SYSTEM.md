# Minerva Function Preservation System

## Purpose
This document outlines the system for preserving all working functions in the Minerva project. The goal is to prevent accidental breakage of functioning code during development and to provide easy recovery options when needed.

## Core Preservation Components

### 1. Function Snapshots
- Working versions of critical functions are preserved in the `/function_snapshots` directory
- Organized by system component (UI, chat, memory, API, visualization, orbital system)
- Each snapshot includes the original function code and documentation

### 2. Protected Code Markers
- Critical functions are marked in source code with `/* PROTECTED FUNCTION - DO NOT MODIFY */` comments
- These markers help prevent accidental changes
- Each protected section includes a reference to its snapshot location

### 3. Recovery System
- Original working files are stored in `/function_snapshots/originals`
- Version control commits are tagged with "WORKING: [component]" when a function is verified to work
- Unit tests ensure functionality remains intact

### 4. Documentation System
- Each critical function has thorough documentation in `/function_snapshots/[component]`
- Documentation includes purpose, parameters, return values, dependencies, and example usage
- Integration points with other system components are clearly defined

## Protected System Components

### User Interface Components
- Orbital UI with 3D visualization
- Chat interface elements
- Project management controls
- Dashboard components
- Navigation elements
- Think Tank interface

### Memory System
- Conversation persistence
- Project-specific memory
- Context management
- Memory retrieval mechanisms
- ChromaDB integration

### Chat System
- Message handling
- Response processing
- Markdown rendering
- User message tracking
- Think Tank integration

### API Integration
- Chat API endpoints
- Project management endpoints
- Think Tank model blending
- Authentication and session management
- External API connections

### Visualization System
- 3D orbital visualization
- Project orb rendering
- Think Tank metrics visualization
- Data analysis visualizations

### Orbital System
- 3D environment rendering
- Project orbit placement
- Holographic UI elements
- Navigation between orbits
- User interaction handling

## Usage Instructions

### Identifying Protected Functions
1. Look for the `/* PROTECTED FUNCTION */` comment marker in the code
2. Reference the corresponding documentation in the `/function_snapshots` directory
3. Review the test cases in the `/tests` directory

### Modifying Protected Functions
If you need to modify a protected function:
1. Create a backup of the current working version
2. Document your intended changes
3. Make minimal, focused changes
4. Run the associated unit tests to verify functionality
5. Update the documentation to reflect your changes

### Recovering Broken Functions
If a protected function stops working:
1. Find the latest working version in `/function_snapshots`
2. Review the git history for the most recent "WORKING:" commit
3. Restore the function to its last working state
4. Debug the issues in isolation before attempting changes again

## Continuous Improvement
This preservation system is designed to evolve over time:
1. Add new critical functions as they are developed
2. Update documentation as the system evolves
3. Refine protection mechanisms based on development experience
4. Integrate with CI/CD pipelines for automated testing
