# Model Scoring & Selection Improvements

## Summary of Enhancements

We've implemented significant improvements to Minerva's model selection and scoring system, enhancing its ability to intelligently select the most appropriate AI model for a given query. These improvements focus on leveraging historical performance data, considering query complexity, and integrating user preferences.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Query Complexity Analysis

- **Sophisticated Complexity Calculation**
  - Implemented a multi-factor complexity scoring system that analyzes:
    - Query length (word count)
    - Presence of technical/specialized terms
    - Domain-specific indicators
  - Added complexity boost detection for specialized domains

- **Adaptive Confidence Thresholds**
  - Created a dynamic confidence threshold system that adjusts based on query complexity
  - Higher thresholds for simple queries (requiring more certainty)
  - Lower thresholds for complex queries (accepting more experimental approaches)

### 2. Improved Historical Performance Weighting

- **Relevance-Based Scoring**
  - Enhanced scoring to weight models based on their performance on similar queries
  - Implemented semantic similarity matching for better context recognition

- **Recency Factors**
  - Added time-weighted scoring that gives higher priority to recent successful interactions
  - Implemented gradual decay for older insights to balance stability and adaptability

- **Complexity Matching**
  - Added logic to match current query complexity with models that performed well on similar complexity levels
  - Enhanced context tracking to store query complexity metadata with each insight

### 3. User Preference Integration

- **Preference-Aware Model Selection**
  - Integrated user preference data (tone, structure, length) into model selection
  - Created preference matching functions to boost models aligned with user preferences

- **Response Style Compatibility**
  - Added tone matching to select models that excel at the user's preferred communication style
  - Implemented length preference matching to prioritize models that naturally generate the desired response length

## Implementation Details

### AI Knowledge Repository Enhancements

1. **Expanded `get_best_model_for_query` Method**
   - Now accepts user preferences as an optional parameter
   - Implements comprehensive scoring adjustments based on multiple factors
   - Returns confidence scores that reflect true performance expectations

2. **Added Helper Methods**
   - `_model_matches_tone`: Determines how well a model can match a specific tone
   - `_model_matches_length`: Evaluates model compatibility with desired response length

### Multi-AI Coordinator Improvements

1. **Enhanced `_model_selection_decision` Method**
   - Implements technical term detection for better complexity assessment
   - Extracts and passes user preferences to the repository
   - Uses smart fallback logic when repository guidance is insufficient

2. **Smarter Default Model Selection**
   - Selects different default models based on query characteristics
   - Considers user preferences when selecting fallback models
   - Adapts timeout duration based on query complexity

3. **Improved Context Tracking**
   - Stores complete decision context with each insight
   - Includes complexity metrics, confidence thresholds, and preference data
   - Enables more sophisticated learning over time

## Benefits

1. **More Accurate Model Selection**
   - Models are selected based on proven performance with similar queries
   - Technical queries get matched with models that excel at complex topics
   - Simple queries get faster, more efficient processing

2. **Enhanced Personalization**
   - Users receive responses from models that match their communication preferences
   - Style consistency improves as the system learns user preferences
   - Response characteristics (length, tone, structure) become more consistent

3. **Optimized Resource Usage**
   - Advanced queries use multiple models only when necessary
   - Simple queries use minimal resources with appropriate models
   - Timeout values adjust based on query complexity

## Next Steps

1. **Continuous Learning System**
   - Implement automatic adjustment of model matching parameters based on ongoing feedback
   - Develop a self-tuning system for complexity assessment

2. **Advanced Context Recognition**
   - Improve detection of specialized domains (scientific, technical, creative)
   - Implement domain-specific model matching

3. **Multi-Model Coordination Enhancement**
   - Develop more sophisticated parallel processing strategies
   - Implement smarter model results aggregation and selection

These improvements significantly enhance Minerva's ability to select the most appropriate model for each query, resulting in better responses and more efficient resource utilization.
